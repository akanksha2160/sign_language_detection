Updated README for Sign Language Detection Repository
Sign Language Detection
This repository provides a framework for detecting and recognizing sign language gestures using machine learning models and computer vision techniques.

Features
Machine Learning Models: Includes implementations using TensorFlow, Keras, and Pytorch.
Real-Time Detection: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time region-of-interest (ROI) detection.
Pre-trained Model: A CNN model is provided (model.h5).
Dataset: Utilizes the Sign Language MNIST dataset from Kaggle.
Dependencies
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
Pytorch (optional)
How to Run
Run ROIinOpenCV.py for real-time detection.
Use sign_language_pytorch.ipynb for the Pytorch implementation.
Dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle.
